Data submitted for publication 2017: Wahl, H.E.; Raudabaugh, D.B.; Bach, E.M.; Bone, T.S.; Luttenton, M.R.; Cichewicz, R.H.; Miller, A.N. What lies beneath? Fungal diversity at the bottom of Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. submtted to Great Lakes Research

Data are ITS1 and ITS2 fungal sequence data extracted from sediment samples collected in Lake Michigan (2014, 2015, and 2016) and Lake Superior (2015, 2016).  Seuqence data was collected on both cultured fungi isolated from the samples and DNA extracted directly from the sample (2015 only).  This repository contains the QIME pipeline code used to conduct quality control and group sequences into opperational taxonomic units (OTUs).  Code used to match OTUs to existing taxa in UNITE and NCBI nBLAST databases is also included.

Statistical code used to evaluate the resulting OTU tables in R is also included.
